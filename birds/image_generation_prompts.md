# Bird Photography Prompts: Gemini Optimized

This document contains professional photography prompts for all 32 birds featured in the "Birds of Port Washington" guide. These prompts have been specifically engineered for the **Gemini** image generation model to produce high-resolution, centered, and photorealistic results.

### Gemini Optimization Tips
- **Aspect Ratio**: Always mention "Square aspect ratio" in your request.
- **Subject Placement**: The "perfectly centered" instruction is critical. Gemini responds well to spatial descriptions like "dead center" or "centered in the middle of the frame."
- **Focus**: Using "Professional full-body photography" or "Macro photography" helps Gemini prioritize sharp details and realistic textures over artistic filters.
- **Composition**: If the bird is not centered enough, try adding "Empty space on all sides of the bird."
